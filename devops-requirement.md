DevOps Practices

Package applications consistently with Docker and orchestrate containers with Kubernetes.

Host applications on Heroku with resources from AWS or GCP as needed.

Set up CI/CD pipelines using GitLab CI and implement GitOps-style deployment with ArgoCD.

Define and manage infrastructure as code using Terraform, and handle server configuration and application deployment with Ansible.

Monitoring and Observability

Implement monitoring solutions using Prometheus and visualize metrics with Grafana.

Utilize Jaeger for distributed tracing and the ELK Stack for log management and analysis.

Manage security with Vault for secrets, Trivy for container scanning, and OWASP ZAP for automated security testing.

Performance Enhancements

Conduct load and performance testing using k6 and implement chaos engineering practices with Chaos Mesh.

Maintain comprehensive documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI for APIs and Docusaurus for technical documentation.
